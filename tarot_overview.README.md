# Tarot Overview

## 1. Tarot Structure and Origin:
- The Tarot pack consists of 78 cards, divided into four suits of 14 cards each, and 22 symbolic picture cards (trumps) numbered 0 to 21.
- The four suits are Wands (or Sceptres, Clubs), Cups, Swords, and Pentacles (or Money, Circles).
- Each suit includes cards from Ace to Ten, and four court cards: Knave, Knight (or Cavalier, Horseman), Queen, and King.
- The 22 trumps are hieroglyphic symbols associated with the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet.
- The Tarot's origins are attributed to a Qabalistico-Egyptian tradition, with roots extending back further than commonly believed. Some believe it predates Moses.
- The Tarot is believed to be the origin of the modern playing card.
- The word "Tarot" is thought to derive from the Egyptian word "t√¢ru" meaning to require an answer, or to consult.

## 2. Symbolism of the Cards:
- The four suits are associated with different elements and aspects of life:
  - **Cups**: Emotions, relationships, and connections, associated with the element of Water.
  - **Wands**: Action, inspiration, and creativity, associated with the element of Fire.
  - **Swords**: Intellect, conflict, and decision-making, associated with the element of Air.
  - **Pentacles**: Material aspects, work, and finances, associated with the element of Earth.
- Each of the 22 trumps has a unique symbolic meaning:
  - For example, the Juggler represents Will, the High Priestess represents knowledge, the Lovers can represent wise disposition or a trial, and the Hanged Man can represent self-sacrifice.
  - These trumps form a narrative sequence that can be interpreted as a connected sentence with the first card representing Will and the last representing Reward.
- The Aces in each suit are seen as keys to their respective suits.

## 3. Card Meanings and Interpretations:
- Each card has upright and reversed meanings:
  - For example, the Juggler upright indicates Will and power, while reversed can indicate weakness of will.
  - The meanings of the court cards may change based on whether they are used as a significator.
- Some cards, especially court cards, can be interpreted as representing people, with different suits signifying different complexions or characteristics.
- The cards should be interpreted in relation to the cards around them and their position in the layout.
- The meanings of cards are sometimes modified based on their relationship to other cards. For example, the Knight of Sceptres indicates the departure of the card following it, and can indicate a quarrel with a woman if the following card is a woman.
- The provided meanings are based on the Italian Tarot tradition. Etteilla's attempted corrections of the symbolism are not recommended for occult study.

## 4. Divination Methods:
- It is essential to thoroughly shuffle and cut the cards three times with the backs of the cards towards the person shuffling, while thinking of the question they are seeking an answer to. This is essential for an accurate reading.
- The three divination methods each involve unique ways to lay out the cards:
  - **Horseshoe Layout**: Divides the deck into three piles with a 2:1 ratio.
  - **Seven Card Rows Layout**: Uses 21 cards plus a significator card in three rows of 7.
  - **Triangle and Arch Layout**: Uses 66 cards in a complex pattern with the significator in the center and various combinations of the cards for the past, present, and future.
- The third method uses the positions of the cards to determine if they are related to the past, present, or future.

## 5. Tarot Gameplay:
- The Tarot can also be used as a game, and has specific rules for scoring points based on combinations of trumps, sequences, and tricks.
- Specific cards have special scoring rules, such as the Fool (0) which is the lowest card but can be played in place of another in order to save it, and can only be taken by the Ace.
- The game is typically played until someone reaches 100 points.

## 6. Occult Significance:
- The Tarot cards are a system of recondite symbolism that goes beyond ordinary playing cards.
- The Tarot is associated with the Qabala, and its 22 trumps are seen as a hieroglyphic alphabet.
- The 22 trumps correspond to the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet and are divided into three Mother Letters, seven double letters, and twelve simple letters.

## 7. Specific Cards and Combinations:
- Certain cards have specific meanings depending on the cards surrounding them or their position in the layout:
  - The Knight of Sceptres indicates the departure of the card following it.
  - The Six of Cups shows what precedes it is past, or if reversed, what is going to happen.
  - The Queen of Swords can indicate a recent or impending loss.
  - The Deuce of Swords reversed might indicate that friends are not useful in the matter being considered.
  - The Queen of Pentacles reversed might mean a lawsuit or not much benefit from winning one.
