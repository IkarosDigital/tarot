# Tarot Divination Methods

This document outlines three methods for laying out Tarot cards for divination, as described in the provided sources. Each method involves shuffling, dealing, and interpreting the cards in a unique way.

## Method 1: The Horseshoe Layout
This method uses the full 78-card pack.

1. **Shuffling and Cutting**: The cards are shuffled and cut thoroughly by the inquirer.
2. **Dealing**: The cards are dealt into two piles, A and B:
   - Pile B receives two cards.
   - Pile A receives one card.
   - This results in:
     - **Pile A**: 26 cards
     - **Pile B**: 52 cards
3. **Second Deal**: The 52 cards in pile B are then dealt into two new piles, C and D, using the same two-to-one distribution:
   - **Pile C**: 17 cards
   - **Pile D**: 35 cards
4. **Third Deal**: The 35 cards in pile D are dealt into piles E and F with the same method:
   - **Pile E**: 11 cards
   - **Pile F**: 24 cards
5. **Discard Pile F**: Pile F is discarded and not used in the reading. This leaves piles A, C, and E.
6. **Arrangement**: The cards in each remaining pile are arranged face up, in a horseshoe shape from right to left, starting with the top card at the lowest right-hand corner, and ending with the last card at the lowest left-hand corner.
7. **Reading**: The cards are read from right to left, as well as combined in pairs (1st and last, 2nd and second-to-last, etc.). The same reading method is used for piles A, C, and E:
   - **A**: 26 cards
   - **C**: 17 cards
   - **E**: 11 cards
8. **Mathematical Basis**: This method uses a 2:1 ratio to divide the initial deck of 78 cards in three steps.

## Method 2: The Seven Card Rows Layout
This method uses 21 cards from a shuffled deck and a significator card.

1. **Significator Selection**: A significator card (King or Queen of the deck) representing the inquirer is chosen and set aside.
2. **Shuffling and Cutting**: The remaining cards are shuffled and cut.
3. **Card Selection**: 21 cards are selected by taking every seventh card, starting with the top card of the shuffled deck.
4. **Arrangement**: The selected cards are placed in three rows of seven cards each, from right to left, on the left-hand side of the significator card.
5. **Reading**: The meaning of each row is read from right to left, beginning with the significator. Cards are then combined in pairs (first with last, second with second to last).

## Method 3: The Triangle and Arch Layout

The third method of Tarot divination, as described in the sources, involves a complex layout of 66 cards around a significator, with specific card positions representing the past, present, and future. The cards are then read in various combinations to provide a comprehensive reading.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the card positions and their interpretations:

1. **Initial Layout**:
   - The cards are dealt face up according to a specific diagram. The first card is placed at position 1, the second card at position 2, and so on, up to position 66. The remaining 11 cards are set aside and not used in the reading.

2. **Card Positions and Time Frames**:
   - **Past**: Positions 1 to 11 and 34 to 44 represent the past.
   - **Present**: Positions 23 to 33 and 56 to 66 represent the present.
   - **Future**: Positions 12 to 22 and 45 to 55 represent the future.

3. **Reading the Cards**:
   - **Sequential Reading**: The cards are read in the order of their position numbers within each time frame (past, present, future). For example, the past is read starting at card 1 then card 2, and so on until card 11 then card 34, 35, etc. until card 44.
   - **Significator Combinations**: The significator card is combined with pairs of cards to read each time frame:
     - **Past**: S. 34 and 1; S. 33 and 2; S. 34 and 3; and so on up to S. 44 and 11.
     - **Present**: S. 56 and 23; S. 57 and 24; and so on.
     - **Future**: S. 45 and 12; S. 46 and 13; up to S. 55 and 22.
   - **Reverse Combinations**: A second combination of cards with the significator is done by starting from the end of each group of cards:
     - **Past**: S. 44 and 1; S. 43 and 2; and so on up to S. 34 and 11.
     - **Present**: S. 66 and 23; S. 65 and 24; up to S. 56 and 33.
     - **Future**: S. 55 and 12; S. 54 and 13; and so on up to S. 45 and 22.
   - **Combined Deck**: The 66 cards are combined by placing 66 on top of 1, 65 on top of 2, 64 on top of 3, and so on, until 34 is placed on top of 33.
   - **Circular Layout**: The combined cards are dealt into a circle with the significator as the starting point.
   - **Final Reading**: The cards in the circle are read in pairs, starting with the significator and the card to its left (S and 66), then the next pair (33 and 1), the next (34 and 2), and so on, until a single card is left.
   - **Surprise Cards**: Two surprise cards are drawn from the 11 unused cards. These are placed on either side of the circle layout and read from right to left as a conclusion to the reading.

The diagram below, from the sources, depicts the layout of cards 1-66:

33 32 31 30 29 28 27 26 25 24 23
66 65 64 63 62 61 60 59 58 57 56
22 55                                           44 11
21   54                                       43   10
20     53                                   42     9
19       52     Sig.   41       8
18         51                           40         7
17           50                       39           6
16             49                   38             5
15               48               37               4
14                 47           36                 3
13                   46       35                   2
12                     45   34                     1
```

This complex method is designed to give a detailed and nuanced reading by examining the cards in multiple ways.
